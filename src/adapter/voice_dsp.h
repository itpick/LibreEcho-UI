/*
 * The floor was capped at 1024, which assumes a microphone path that idles
 * near silence.  On hardware whose capture saturates, the idle stream sits
 * far above that -- measured here at 2400-3300 RMS in a quiet room, against
 * roughly 19000 for speech.  A cap of 1024 puts the six-times-energy gate at
 * about 2500 RMS, at or below the room's own noise, so the detector latches
 * active on the first frame and never releases: end-of-speech cannot fire and
 * every turn runs to its maximum length.  Allow the floor to reach the noise
 * level such hardware actually produces.
